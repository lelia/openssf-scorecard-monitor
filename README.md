# OpenSSF Scorecard Monitor

**Simplify OpenSSF Scorecard tracking in your organization with automated markdown and JSON reports, plus optional GitHub issue alerts.**

## üîÆ About

If you're feeling overwhelmed by an avalanche of repository scorecards in your organization, you can breathe easy: Automation is here to make your life easier! It will streamline the process of keeping track of them all by providing a comprehensive report in Markdown and a local database in JSON with all the scores. Furthermore, to stay on top of any changes in the scores, you can choose to get notifications through Github Issues.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

Please ensure that any repository you wish to track with Scorecard Monitor has already been analyzed by [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) at least once. This can be accomplished using the official [GitHub Action](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action) or the [Scorecard CLI](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard?tab=readme-ov-file#scorecard-command-line-interface). It's also possible that some repositories in your organization are already being [automatically tracked](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/faq.md#can-i-preview-my-projects-score) by OpenSSF via this [CSV file](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/cron/internal/data/projects.csv)!

If you're not sure whether a specific project is already using Scorecard, you can always spot-check with the following URL pattern: `https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/<ORG_NAME>/<REPO_NAME>` (substitute `<ORG_NAME>` and `<REPO_NAME>` as appropriate). The [Scorecard API](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/) is also able to fetch scores for a given repository.

## üì° Usage

### Standalone with auto discovery version

With the following workflow, you will get the most out of this action:

- Trigger manually or by Cron job every Sunday
- It will scan the org(s) in scope looking for repositories that are available in the OpenSSF Scorecard
- It will store the database and the scope files in the repo
- It will generate an issue if there are changes in the score

```yml
name: "OpenSSF Scoring"
on: 
  # Scheduled trigger
  schedule:
    # Run every Sunday at 00:00
    - cron: "0 0 * * 0"
  # Manual trigger
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  # Write access in order to update the local files with the reports
  contents: write
  # Write access only required if creating PRs (see Advanced Tips below)
  pull-requests: none 
  # Write access in order to create issues
  issues: write
  packages: none

jobs:
  security-scoring:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: OpenSSF Scorecard Monitor
        uses: UlisesGascon/openssf-scorecard-monitor@v2.0.0-beta6
        with:
          scope: reporting/scope.json
          database: reporting/database.json
          report: reporting/openssf-scorecard-report.md
          auto-commit: true
          auto-push: true
          generate-issue: true
          # The token is needed to create issues, discovery mode and pushing changes in files
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          discovery-enabled: true
          # As an example nodejs Org and Myself
          discovery-orgs: 'UlisesGascon,nodejs'
```

      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: OpenSSF Scorecard Monitor
        uses: UlisesGascon/openssf-scorecard-monitor@v2.0.0-beta6

        run: |
          echo '${{ steps.openssf-scorecard-monitor.outputs.scores }}'  
```

## üöÄ Advanced Tips

### Avoid committing directly to the branch and instead generate a PR

If you have implemented the recommended branch protection rules from the OpenSSF Scorecard, committing and pushing directly to the `main` branch will be impossible. An easy alternative is to extend the pipeline to automatically generate a PR for you:

```yml
name: "OpenSSF Scoring"
on: 
  # ...

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write
  packages: none

jobs:
  security-scoring:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: OpenSSF Scorecard Monitor
        uses: UlisesGascon/openssf-scorecard-monitor@v2.0.0-beta6
        id: openssf-scorecard-monitor
        with:
          auto-commit: false
          auto-push: false
          generate-issue: true
          # ....
      - name: Print the scores
        run: |
          echo '${{ steps.openssf-scorecard-monitor.outputs.scores }}'
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@38e0b6e68b4c852a5500a94740f0e535e0d7ba54 # v4.2.4
        with:
            token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            commit-message: OpenSSF Scorecard Report Updated
            title: OpenSSF Scorecard Report Updated
            body: OpenSSF Scorecard Report Updated
            base: main
            assignees: ${{ github.actor }}
            branch: openssf-scorecard-report-updated
            delete-branch: true
```

### Embed Report version

If you want to mix the report in markdown format with other content, then you can use `report-tags-enabled=true` then report file will use the tags to add/update the report summary without affecting what is before or after the tagged section.

This is very useful for static websites, here is [an example using docusaurus](https://github.com/onebeyond/maintainers/blob/main/docs/reporting/scorecard.md).

### Custom tags

By default we use `<!-- OPENSSF-SCORECARD-MONITOR:START -->` and `<!-- OPENSSF-SCORECARD-MONITOR:END -->`, but this can be customize by adding your custom tags as `report-start-tag` and `report-end-tag`

### Increase HTTP request in parallel

You can control the amount of parallel requests performed against the OpenSSF Scorecard Api by defining any numerical value in `max-request-in-parallel`, like `max-request-in-parallel=15`.

By default the value is 10, higher values might not be a good use of the API and you can hit some limits, please check with OpenSSF if you want to rise the limits safely.

### Exclude repos

In some scenarios we want to enable the auto-discovery mode but we want to ignore certain repos, the best way to achieve that is by editing the `scope.json` file and add any report that you want to ignore in the `excluded` section for that specific organization.

### Scoping Structure

Just for reference, the scope will be stored this way:

File: `reporting/scope.json`

```json
{
    "github.com": {
      "included": {
        "UlisesGascon":[
          "tor-detect-middleware", 
          "check-my-headers", 
          "express-simple-pagination"
        ]
      },
      "excluded": {
        "UlisesGascon": [
          "demo-stuff"
        ]
      }
    }

}
```

### Database structure

Just for reference, the database will store the current value and previous values with the date:

```json
{
  "github.com": {
    "UlisesGascon": {
      "check-my-headers": {
        "previous": [ {
          "score": 6.7,
          "date": "2022-08-21"
        }],
        "current": {
          "score": 4.4,
          "date": "2022-11-28"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
